  <strong>Welcome to my personal project</strong>
  
  This is a project that attempts to digitize the card game Palace through the command-line and then, hopefully, evolving into a GUI supported game that will ambitiously be made available through some sort of game store page. Only ambition and dedication will really tell how far this repository will go.
</p>

## Additional Information 
The game is currently underdevelopment and in it's command-line stage.
